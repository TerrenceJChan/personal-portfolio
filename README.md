## Attributions and Credits
It takes a village after all! Below are a list of attributions to resources that have helped me along the way of creating my site.

### Normalize.css
This stylesheet helps with removing weird browser bugs and default margins and paddings (especially helped with vh/vw issues).

### Scrolling Effects
Using Scroll Snap, I implemented some nice scroll effects to my different sections. Major props to my friend Ian Lai who helped me figure out some terribly annoying problems with getting scroll snapping to work. I guess I didn't have to resort to Javascript this time around.

### Clickable Divs
I wanted to add a hover effect over the images that changes opacity and reveals text, but I realized that would be problematic with an img source. I opted for using a background-image while wrapping an anchor tag instead. I also added role and aria-label attributes to make up for not having an alt attribute.
